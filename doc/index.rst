HMMLearn: Hidden Markov Models in Python with scikit-learn like API
=====================================================================

|

* Simple aglorithms and models to learn HMMs (hidden markov models) in Python
* Follows scikit-learn API as close as possible, but adapted to sequence data
* Built on scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib 
* Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

.. warning:: **Unmaintained**

   HMMLearn is a derivative of the unmaintained HMM code in scikit-learn.
   It has been put outside of scikit-learn because it was unmaintained
   and could not match scikit-learn's API. As of today it has not found a
   maintainer, which means that questions will go unanswered and bugs
   will not be fixed.
